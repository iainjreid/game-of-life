# Day 1 — March 3rd, 2020

After a lot of procrastinating with Blink, another side to this project, I
finally moved on and decided to implement the first iteration of Conway's Game
of Life in JavaScript.

It didn't take long, which was a relief seeing that I'd already frittered away a
large part of the day!

# Day 2 — March 4th, 2020

A much more productive session today. I used Python for this implementation, and
although the finished product isn't nearly as elegant as a more experienced
Pythonista would produce, I can definitely see why so many people love to work
with the language!

I rarely use Python myself, so this turned out to be a nice little challenge.

# Day 3 — March 5th, 2020

Another smooth run today, one more implementation down! Today's implementation
is written in Ruby, and it's a looker.

I feel that Ruby is a bit laborious to write, what with all of its `end`
statements, but aside from that it's a pleasure to use. It feels very much like
Python, and shares a some great syntax bonuses such as `and`/`or`; and ranges
are another hugely useful feature that my go to language JavaScript doesn't
have, so they're _always_ welcome.

# Day 4 — March 6th, 2020

Today was pretty tough, I choose to go with Haskell, and oh my, was it a steep
learning curve.

A few years ago I read a great introductory book on Haskell (that I couldn't
recommend more) called "Learn You a Haskel for Great Good". At the time I felt
as though I was getting a grasp on the syntax and language structure in general,
but I failed to put those learnings into practice, and between then and now, it
looks as though I'd managed to forget _everything_.

# Day 5 — March 7th, 2020

A very entertaining implementation today using just vanilla POSIX shell! This
meant no access to arrays or Bashisms, and therefore a much more challenging
task in general.
