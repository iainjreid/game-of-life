# Day 1 — March 3rd, 2020

After a lot of procrastinating with Blink, another side to this project, I
finally moved on and decided to implement the first iteration of Conway's Game
of Life in JavaScript.

It didn't take long, which was a relief seeing that I'd already frittered away a
large part of the day!

# Day 2 — March 4th, 2020

A much more productive session today. I used Python for this implementation, and
although the finished product isn't nearly as elegant as a more experienced
Pythonista would produce, I can definitely see why so many people love to work
with the language!

I rarely use Python myself, so this turned out to be a nice little challenge.
